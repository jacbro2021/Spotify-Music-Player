# Spotify UI Remake
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "normal.png"/>
</div>

For this project I recreated the spotify music player UI with one of my favorite songs, Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix. In building this, I became more comfortable working with Zstacks, Hstacks, and Vstacks in SwiftUI and gained experience using various other views and modifiers.

<div align = "center">
  <img src = "clicked.png"/>
</div>

Several of the buttons in this UI remake change when clicked! the like button, play button, and the next song / previous song buttons all change on click. In addition to this, the current play time changes when the slider is dragged to a new position.
